Freight RFQ Workflow Analysis
=============================

Current State:
- RFQ detail page exists at /freight/rfqs/:id
- "Send to Carriers" button opens a dialog
- Dialog shows "No carriers found" - need to add freight carriers first
- Has "Add carriers first" link
- Shows "Send to 0 Carriers" button (disabled effectively)
- Has "Add Quote Manually" option

Issues Found:
1. No freight carriers in the system to send RFQs to
2. Need to check if freight carriers table/feature exists
3. Need to implement the actual email sending when carriers are selected

Next Steps:
1. Check if freightCarriers table exists in schema
2. Add freight carriers management page if needed
3. Implement email sending to carriers
4. Implement quote response collection
5. Add quote comparison and selection UI
