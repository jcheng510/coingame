Freight RFQ Workflow Analysis - January 9, 2026

CURRENT STATE:
1. The "Send to Carriers" button WORKS - it generates AI-powered emails and saves them to the database
2. RFQ status updates from "draft" to "sent" after sending
3. Email History section shows the sent emails with timestamps
4. Toast notification confirms "RFQ sent to 2 carriers! Email drafts created"

WHAT'S MISSING:
1. Actual email delivery - emails are saved as "drafts" but not actually sent via SMTP/email service
2. Email response monitoring - no way to automatically receive and parse carrier responses
3. Quote comparison UI - exists but needs quotes to be entered manually or parsed from emails

NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE THE WORKFLOW:
1. Add actual email sending capability (integrate with notification service or add SMTP)
2. Add "Add Quote from Email" button functionality to parse carrier responses
3. Implement AI quote analysis and comparison
4. Add one-click quote acceptance to create booking

The UI and backend logic are largely complete - just need to:
- Actually send the emails (currently just saving as drafts)
- Provide a way to input carrier responses (manual entry or email parsing)
- Enable quote comparison and acceptance
